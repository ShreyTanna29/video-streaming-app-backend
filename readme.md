# Intro Of Project
This repo contains a backend logic of a video streaming site. I have written it as a side project but still I have kept all production-level practices and principles in mind.     

# Run locally
To run it locally download this code and make sure you have created a mongoDB database and have its ID. You will also need cloudinary URL and ID as I have its service to upload profile pics and avatars of users. After this setup create an .env file mention this IDs and URLs in it and also mention port where you want server to run and you are good to go. Just run "npm install" command to install all dependencies and then run "npm run dev" to start the server locally.
